# Projekt-Kalci
A beginner's calculator, coded by a novice in Python Programming.
Projekt-Kalci makes use of all the knowledge I have gathered throughout my Python journey so far i.e., this program was built using functions, pre-built modules, conditional statements, loops, recursions,arithmetic and comparison operators.
