# Projekt-Kalci
A beginner's calculator  coded by a novice in Python Programming, Projekt-Kalci makes use of all the knowledge I have gathered throughout my Python journey so far i.e., this program was built using functions, pre-built modules, conditional statements, loops, recursions,arithmetic and comparison operators.
For this project however, I will limit this calculator to performing operations between two input numbers only.
