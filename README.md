# Projekt-Kalci
A beginner's calculator, coded by a novice in Python Programming.

This project makes use of all the knowledge I have gathered throughout my Python journey so far. It makes use of functions, pre-built modules, conditional statements, loops, recursions,arithmetic and comparison operators.
